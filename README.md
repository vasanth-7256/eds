The **Employee Directory with Search** project includes several useful features that make managing employee information simple and efficient. It allows users to store and organize details such as employee names, IDs, departments, designations, email addresses, and phone numbers. The built-in search functionality helps users quickly locate employees by name, department, or job title, while the department-wise filtering option makes it easy to view staff from specific teams. Administrators can add, edit, and delete records to keep the directory up to date. The system also offers sorting options to arrange employee data based on name, ID, or position. With a user-friendly and responsive interface, it ensures smooth access across different devices. Additionally, the project incorporates secure data handling to protect employee information and ensure that only authorized users can access or modify records.
